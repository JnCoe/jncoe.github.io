                            <p>Marion Grasby started life in the tropical city of Darwin, where the papaya salads are
                                spicy and the mangoes are sweet and sticky. Marion is a little bit Thai (courtesy of her
                                Mum) and a little bit Australian (courtesy of her Dad). Her love of food and travel
                                became ingrained at an early age as her globetrotting parents lived and travelled in
                                Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Australia.</p>
                            <p>Marion is a passionate cook, writer, presenter and creator of the Marion's Kitchen Asian
                                food range. Her cookbook, Marion: Recipes and Stories from a Hungry Cook, was released
                                in 2011 and she has a monthly food column in Masterchef Magazine.</p>
